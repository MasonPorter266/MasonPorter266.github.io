Semester Portfolio Website

This is an assignment for my school. It is called Semester Portfolio and it has completed works that showcase my knowledge in programming.
This assignment also is a list of the web standards my school wants us to use when working on projects.

Assignment requirements:
------------------------
This is the website you have been dreaming of! 

This is a professional site to show off your work and your design should reflect that intent. 

You are going to create a website to show off your web/design skills. You are going to host this site off of the school network. 

Coders can use Github, designers can use a free Wordpress host (Up to 3 gigs)


Your site will include 2 sections: 

1. A section devoted to your design/coding/marketable tech skills with links to sites you've made. These sites will need to be migrated to your new offsite host.

2. You may want to polish and perfect the sites you've created thus far. Fix any problem areas. You will be using this site to gain your internships/jobs. 

3. The second section of your site will be devoted to showing off and proving out your web standards 1-5. This section will be complete and thorough. Create a menu link with a button for each of the five standards. Then create a submenu for each of the sub standards, for instance Standard 1 will have 3 sub standards. On each sub standard page, you will use the paragraph you wrote with examples to prove that you have mastered this standard. You will link to your other websites as proof here.
